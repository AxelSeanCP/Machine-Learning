Concrete Compressive Strength

background:
- concrete is used in almost all construction programs because its known for its strength and durability.
because concrete is a critical factor in determining the performance of a structure.
however there is a risk for non-safe structure because the concrete is not strong enough.
to determine the strength and durability, civil engineers use the concrete compresive strength unit.
it is a parameters that civil engineers use to design safe concrete structures.

why project domain need to be solved
- to ensure a safe and efficient structure with minimal risk of failure, that will also benefited the potential people who will use the structure

how project domain will be solved
- using machine learning algorithms to predict the compressive strength of a concrete and determine which concrete is strong enough to build a safe structure


business understanding
in the construction industry it is important to determine the strength of the concrete to ensure structural integrity and safety of the buildings.
civil engineers and contractors need methods to predict concrete strength as early as possible to reduce cost, avoid over design, etc.
with machine learning it is possible to predict the concrete strength based on various factors such as the components, the age, etc

problem statement
- what are the key features that determine the compressive strength of a concrete
- how to predict the concrete compressive strength before begining to test it

goals
- identify the key features that correlate with compressive strength of concrete
- develop a machine learning model to predict the compressive strength of concrete
