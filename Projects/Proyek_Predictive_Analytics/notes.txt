Concrete Compressive Strength

background:
- concrete is used in almost all construction programs because its known for its strength and durability.
because concrete is a critical factor in determining the performance of a structure.
however there is a risk for non-safe structure because the concrete is not strong enough.
to determine the strength and durability, civil engineers use the concrete compresive strength unit.
it is a parameters that civil engineers use to design safe and efficient structures.

why project domain need to be solved
- to ensure a safe and efficient structure with minimal risk of failure, that will also benefited the potential people who will use the structure

how project domain will be solved
- using machine learning algorithms to predict the compressive strength of a concrete and determine which concrete is strong enough to build a safe structure


business understanding
in the construction industry it is important to determine the strength of the concrete to ensure structural integrity and safety of the buildings.
civil engineers and contractors need methods to predict concrete strength as early as possible to reduce cost, avoid over design, etc.
with machine learning it is possible to predict the concrete strength based on various factors such as the components, the age, etc

problem statement
- what are the key features that determine the compressive strength of a concrete
- how to predict the concrete compressive strength before begining to test it

goals
- identify the key features that correlate with compressive strength of concrete
- develop a machine learning model to predict the compressive strength of concrete

solution statement:
- using multiple machine learning algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, Boosting

side notes:
- use metrics RMSE, why?:
The RMSE has some benefits over both MAE and MSE:

    It has the same unit as the target variable, like MAE, but not too different, like MSE.
    It penalises large errors more than small errors like MSE, but not too much like MSE.

However, the RMSE also has some drawbacks:

    It is still sensitive to outliers like MSE.
    It is not easily interpretable like MAE.
If you want a compromise between MAE and MSE, you can use Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) which is more sensitive to outliers than MAE but less sensitive than MSE.
If you care more about large errors than small ones or want to penalise models that make large mistakes, you might prefer MSE or RMSE over MAE.
If you want a metric with the same unit as your actual and predicted values, you might prefer RMSE over MSE or MAE.

- reason to not implement dimensionality reduction:
* dimensional reduction reduces the number of features but doesn't change the nature of the dataset. 
since i have a small dataset, using dimensionality reduction might reduces the sample of my dataset and affect model development.
hence i refrain from using dimensional reduction methods.

things that could go south:
- missing values (assumption is the 0 means the component wasn't used)
- water has low correlation with concrete strength
- not implementing dimension reduction
